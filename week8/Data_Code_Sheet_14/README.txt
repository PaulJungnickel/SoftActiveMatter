This directory contains example data in case you didn't manage to simulate the Rouse model by yourself.

rousecoords2d_sample.txt has the coordinates for a 2D simulation, which can be animated using Animation_Polymer.py.

rousedat_end2end__runs_[]_N_[].txt files contain two rows of data. Row 1 gives the time, and row 2 gives the mean end-to-end vector deviation at the time. These data can be used for the plots in exercises 1d and 1e.
